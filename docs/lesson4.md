## Data management (a collaborative lesson)

With a basic understanding of how git, GitHub, and GitHub pages work, we will now work collaboratively to share our data management practices. This semi-structured session will have a mixture of presentation style aspects mixed with interactive discussion based approaches. Included in this session will be a discussion of components of transparent/reproducible reporting and how to integrate these concepts early in your data management practices.
